## 🐛 Known Issues

### Lint Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Tailwind CSS suggests `bg-linear-to-*` instead of `bg-gradient-to-*`
- These are just style suggestions and don't affect functionality
- Can be ignored or updated in a future cleanup

---

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. **Reusability**
The BookingsTable component can be used anywhere:
- User booking pages ✅
- Admin booking management (future)
- Hotel staff interfaces (future)
- Reporting pages (future)

### 2. **Flexibility**
Hide/show any feature:
```tsx
showSearch={false}      // Hide search
showFilters={false}     // Hide filters
showActions={false}     // Hide action buttons
```

### 3. **Professional UI**
Matches the quality of the Admin Dashboard with:
- Modern gradients
- Smooth animations
- Intuitive layout
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 4. **Performance**
- Client-side filtering (instant results)
- Efficient data transformation
- Optimized re-renders
- Loading states for async operations

---

## 📝 Notes

### Currency Handling
⚠️ **Important**: The component expects `totalPrice` in **cents** (integer)
- Backend stores: 150000 (cents)
- Component displays: $1,500.00 (divides by 100)
- This prevents floating-point precision issues

### Date Handling
- Accepts both `Date` objects and ISO strings
- Uses `date-fns` for formatting
- Format: "MMM dd, yyyy" (e.g., "Oct 26, 2025")

### Status Types
```typescript
BookingStatus: 'PROVISIONAL' | 'CONFIRMED' | 'CANCELLED'
PaymentStatus: 'PENDING' | 'SUCCEEDED' | 'FAILED' | 'REFUNDED' | 'CANCELLED'
```

---

## 🎓 Learning Points

### 1. **Component Reusability**
Created a truly reusable component that:
- Accepts flexible props
- Handles its own state (search, filters, sorting)
- Provides callbacks for actions
- Works in multiple contexts

### 2. **Type Safety**
- Defined clear TypeScript interfaces
- Ensured type compatibility
- Added optional fields properly
- Used proper type transformations

### 3. **Professional UI/UX**
- Consistent color scheme
- Smooth animations
- Clear visual feedback
- Intuitive interactions
- Helpful empty states

### 4. **Data Flow**
```
Database → Server Action → Type Transformation → Component → Display
```
