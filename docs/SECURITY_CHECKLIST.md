## ðŸ†˜ Incident Response Quick Reference

### If Rate Limiting Fails
1. Check Redis connection
2. Verify Redis persistence
3. Check application logs for rate limiter errors
4. Fallback: Increase rate limits temporarily via config

### If Authentication Breach Suspected
1. Rotate all JWT secrets immediately
2. Invalidate all refresh tokens in database
3. Force all users to re-login
4. Review audit logs for suspicious activity
5. Notify affected users

### If DDoS Attack
